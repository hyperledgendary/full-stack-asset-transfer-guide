cd workshop
export WORKSHOP=$(pwd)
```

First please check you've got the [required tools](../../SETUP.md) needed for the dev part of this workshop (docker, just, weft, nodejs, and Fabric peer binary). To double check run the `check.sh` script

```
${WORKSHOP}/check.sh
```

Let's dive straight into creating some code to manage an 'asset'; best to have two windows open, one for running the 'FabricNetwork' and one for 'ChaincodeDev'. You may wish to open a third to watch the logs of the running Fabric Network.

## Start the Fabric Infrastructure

We're using MicroFab for the Fabric infrastructure as it's a single container that is fast to start.
The MicroFab container includes an ordering service node and a peer process that is pre-configured to create a channel and start external chaincodes.
It also includes credentials for an `org1` organization, which will be used to run the peer. We'll use an `org1` admin user when interacting with the environment.

We'll use `just` recipes to execute multiple commands. `just` recipes are similar to `make` but simpler to understand. You can open each justfile to see which commands are run with each recipe.

Start the MicroFab container by running the `just` recipe:

```bash
just -f dev.justfile microfab
```

A file `org1admin.env` is written out that contains the environment variables needed to run applications _as the org1 admin identity_.

Let's take a look at the environment variables and source the file to set the environment variables:

```bash
cat _cfg/uf/org1admin.env

source _cfg/uf/org1admin.env
```

At this point you may wish to run `docker logs -f microfab` in a separate window to watch the activity - you don't need to setup anything specific here.

## Package and deploy chaincode to Fabric

We are going to use the Chaincode-As-A-Service (CCAAS) pattern for chaincode.
With the CCAAS pattern, the Fabric peer does not launch a deployed chaincode.
Instead, we will run chaincode as an external process so that we can easily start, stop, update, and debug the chaincode locally.
But we still need to tell the peer where the chaincode is running. We do this by deploying a chaincode package that only includes the name of the chaincode and chaincode address, rather than the actual chaincode source code.

You can either package and deploy the chaincode using a single `just` recipe, or do it step by step manually.

### Option 1 : Package and deploy chaincode using `just` recipe.

```bash
just -f ${WORKSHOP}/dev.justfile debugcc
```

You will see the chaincode id and deployment steps returned.

### Option 2 : Package and deploy chaincode manually using peer CLI commands.

To run the commands manually:

```bash
export CHAINCODE_SERVER_ADDRESS=host.docker.internal:9999

weft chaincode package caas --path . --label asset-tx-ts --address ${CHAINCODE_SERVER_ADDRESS} --archive asset-tx-ts.tgz --quiet
```

The returned 'chaincode-id' (or package-id) such as `asset-tx-ts:133f3cdf089ae8e20fdda3e0a98cde3eb15ddbcf319bc83cb919ee28763d6e3e` will be needed later.

Your id may be different. Set an environment variable for the chaincode-id that was returned to you, for example:

```
export CHAINCODE_ID=asset-tx-ts:133f3cdf089ae8e20fdda3e0a98cde3eb15ddbcf319bc83cb919ee28763d6e3e
```

We're going to use the peer CLI commands to install and deploy the chaincode. Chaincode is 'deployed' by indicating agreement to it and then committing it to a channel:

```
source _cfg/uf/org1admin.env

peer lifecycle chaincode install asset-tx-ts.tgz
peer lifecycle chaincode approveformyorg --channelID mychannel --name asset-tx -v 0 --package-id $CHAINCODE_ID --sequence 1 --connTimeout 15s
peer lifecycle chaincode commit --channelID mychannel --name asset-tx -v 0 --sequence 1 --connTimeout 15s

```

(best to keep this window open for later)


## Run the chaincode locally

We'll use the example typescript contract already written in `$WORKSHOP/contracts/asset-tx-typescript`. Feel free to take a look at the contract code in `contracts/asset-tx-typescript/src/assetTransfer`.

As with any typescript module we need to run `npm install` to manage the dependencies and then build (compile) the typescript to javascript.

Use another terminal window for the chaincode:

```
cd contracts/asset-tx-typescript

npm install

npm run build
```

On it's own a smart contract can't do a lot, however an easy way to test the contract has been built ok, is to generate the 'Contract Metatadata'. This is a language agnostic definition of the contracts, and the datatypes the contract returns. It borrows from the OpenAPI used for defining REST APIs.  It is also very useful to share to teams writing client applications so they know the data structures and transaction functions they can call.
As it's a JSON document, it's amenable to process to create other resources.

The metadata-generate command has been put into the `package.json`:

```
npm run metadata
```

Review the `metadata.json` and see the summary of the contract information, the transaction functions, and datatypes. This information can also be captured at runtime and is a good way of testing deployment.


## Iterative Development and Test

**All the steps up until here are one time only. You can now iterate over the development of your contract**

From your chaincode terminal window lets start the Smart Contract node module. Remember that the `CHAINCODE_ID` and the `CHAINCODE_SERVER_ADDRESS` are the only pieces of information needed.

Note: Use your specific CHAINCODE_ID from earlier.

```
export CHAINCODE_SERVER_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:9999
export CHAINCODE_ID=asset-tx-ts:133f3cdf089ae8e20fdda3e0a98cde3eb15ddbcf319bc83cb919ee28763d6e3e

# or if you ran the short cut above...
# source ${WORKSHOP}/_cfg/uf/org1admin.env

npm run start:server-debug
```

### Run some transactions

Choose a terminal window to run the transactions from; initially we'll use the `peer` CLI to run the commands.
Make sure that the peer binary and the config directory are set (run the `${WORKKOP}/check.sh script to double check).

Set up the environment context for acting as the Org 1 Administrator.

```
source ${WORKSHOP}/_cfg/uf/org1admin.env
```

Use the peer CLI to issue basic query commands against the contract. For example check the metadata for the contract (if you have jq, it's easier to read if you pipe the results into jq). Use one of these commands:

```
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n asset-tx -c '{"Args":["org.hyperledger.fabric:GetMetadata"]}'
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n asset-tx -c '{"Args":["org.hyperledger.fabric:GetMetadata"]}' | jq
```

Let's create an asset with ID=001:

```
peer chaincode invoke -C mychannel -n asset-tx -c '{"Args":["CreateAsset","{\"ID\":\"001\", \"Color\":\"Red\",\"Size\":52,\"Owner\":\"Fred\",\"AppraisedValue\":234234}"]}' --connTimeout 15s
```

And read back that asset:

```
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n asset-tx -c '{"Args":["ReadAsset","001"]}'
```

You'll see the asset returned:

```
{"AppraisedValue":234234,"Color":"Red","ID":"001","Owner":"{\"org\":\"org1MSP\",\"user\":\"Fred\"}","Size":52}
```

### Making a change and re-running the code

If we invoke a query command on a asset that does not exist, for example 002, we'll get back an error:

```
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n asset-tx -c '{"Args":["ReadAsset","002"]}'
```

returns error:

```
Error: endorsement failure during query. response: status:500 message:"Sorry, asset 002 has not been created"
```

Let's say we want to change that error message to something else.

- Stop the running chaincode (CTRL-C!)
- Load the `src/assetTransfer.ts` file into an editor of your choice
- Around line 51, find the error string and make a modification. remembering to save the change
- Rebuild this as it's typscreipt with "npm run build"

You can now restart the contract as before

```
npm run start:server-debug
```


And run the same query, and see the updated error message:

```
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n asset-tx -c '{"Args":["ReadAsset","002"]}'
```
